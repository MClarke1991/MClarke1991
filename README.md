My current research focuses on understanding and predicting the safety and security of AI systems, applying my prior experience in mechanistic interpretability of both biological and computational networks. 

Previously, I was a postdoc at the Cancer Institute at University College London, where I combined biology and computer science to predict cancer evolution and plan treatment programs to avert or overcome resistance. I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge, exploring how computational network models could be used to find more effective combination treatments for breast cancer. As a postdoc at the Fisher Lab in the UCL Cancer Institute, I built upon this work to predict resistance mechanisms to radiotherapy and find the most effective patient-specific treatments.
